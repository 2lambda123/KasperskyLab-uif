## Palette

You can see the current palette [here](https://[storybook-link]/v6/?path=/story/design-colors--palette)

The palette assumes the presence of two themes: light and dark. Light theme colors have __Light, dark theme colors have __Dark

### Color Palette

The color palette consist of two sections: colors that have dark and light themes, and fixed colors that do not change when the theme changes.

* Dynamic colors - have a pair in dark theme
* Static colors - the same in dark and light themes
* Basic colors - are the base for static and non-static palettes
* Secondary colors - remain the same in dark/light themes. They are basic (they can be referenced by other palettes), but are also used on their own, e.g. in charts.

### How to work in a theme with a palette?

* To work with the palette, as part of component styling, objects with colors and sizes (if necessary) are created. If the component has several states, for example, active, focus, pressed - the object looks like:

````

const component = {
  active: {
    ...
  },
  focus: {
    ...
  },
  pressed: {
    ...
  }
}

````

For example, you can take the styling of the component [Button in Dark theme](../theme/themes/dark/button.ts)

### How to add your palette?

This issue must be discussed with the project maintainers as part of a separate task in the form of __github issue__

### Tokens 

* Export the color palette from Figma is placed in the file `tokens/figma-colors-tokens.json`.
* Based on it, gulp task - updateColors builds a file with __color tokens__ tokens/palette.ts.

This is how a group of palette tokens looks like, which are semantically grouped into theme tokens (themeColors object will be discussed below)

```json

const palette = {
  "staticblack": "rgba(13, 13, 21, 1)",
  "staticwhite": "rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)",
  "lga900": "rgba(8, 89, 165, 0.02)",
  "lga800": "rgba(15, 81, 157, 0.04)",
  "lga700": "rgba(41, 77, 117, 0.09)",
  "lga600": "rgba(29, 54, 83, 0.17)",
  "lga500": "rgba(31, 50, 71, 0.27)",
  ...
}

```

__Tokens__ is an atomic entity in the form of a variable with a specific value.
__The final task of the token__ is to convert into a value that implies some __css-property__.
The Design System tokens are __grouped into semantic groups and assembled into one object__.

```json

export const themeColors = {
  "text-icons-elements": {
    "primary": {
      "light": "rgba(13, 13, 21, 1)", <-- staticblack from palette object
      "dark": "rgba(245, 248, 251, 1)"
    },
  ...
  },
  "bg": {
    "base": {
      "light": "rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)",
      "dark": "rgba(13, 13, 21, 1)"
    },
    "alternative": {
      "light": "rgba(248, 250, 252, 1)",
      "dark": "rgba(26, 25, 37, 1)"
    },
    "alternative2": {
      "light": "rgba(244, 247, 250, 1)",
      "dark": "rgba(29, 28, 40, 1)"
    }
  },
  ...
  "fixedneutralcolor_baseiconwhite": "rgba(231, 241, 253, 0.49)",
  "fixedneutralcolor_seporatorwhite": "rgba(191, 197, 238, 0.12)",
  ...
}

```
## Themes

### How is the theme organized?

__Theme__ consists of a set of __tokens__
For example, this is how a group of color tokens for text and icons looks like ( light theme ), each of the aliases ( primary ) of the color property (`"rgba(13, 13, 21, 1)"`) is a separate token.
A similar group exists for other themes (for example, dark)

```json
{
    light: {
        "text-icons-elements": {
          "primary": "rgba(13, 13, 21, 1)",
          "secondary": "rgba(42, 53, 65, 0.85)",
          "secondary2": "rgba(42, 53, 65, 0.7)",
        }
    }, 
    dark: {
      ...
    }
}
```

Often tokens can be used in any context since their names are rather abstract.


### How to add your theme?

* All themes are in the themes directory
* Similar to creating existing themes, you need to create a directory with your theme ( For example: themes/midnight )
* The main file inside the above directory will be the colors.ts file containing the colors object with your theme colors. The object contains aliases as color names and the aforementioned palette __tokens__.
> Important! The base theme from which the others are inherited is the light theme. As an example, you can see how the [Dark theme] is arranged (../theme/themes/dark/colors.ts)
* In order for a component to use your theme, you need to create a separate file for it in the themes/ folder for each theme. For example, themes/dark/button.ts
> Important! Only Component Tokens are used to style a component.
* Each theme directory has an index file that contains an aggregated theme object for all member components of that theme.

Below is the size of the aggregating object on the example of the dark theme
```json

// design-system/theme/themes/dark/index.ts

import { ThemeKey, ThemeConfig } from '../../../types' 
import { COMMON_THEME } from '../common-theme'
import { colors } from './colors' <-- theme color tokens dark -  design-system/theme/themes/dark/colors.ts
import { button, buttonSize } from './button' <-- Button component tokens
import { link, linkSize } from './link'
import { badge, badgeSize } from './badge'

export const DARK_THEME: ThemeConfig = {
  ...COMMON_THEME, <-- common tokens which used in al themes (shapes, spaces e.g)
  key: ThemeKey.Dark, <-- theme key
  colors, <-- color tokens from this theme  ( in current case color tokens Dark theme - design-system/theme/themes/dark/colors.ts)
  components: { <-- object with color tokens
    button: { <-- token aggregation for <button> component
      colors: button({ colors }), <-- color tokens for Button
      sizes: buttonSize <-- sizing tokens
    },
    link: {  <-- token aggregation for the <link> component
      colors: link({ colors }),
      sizes: linkSize
    },
    badge: { <-- token aggregation for the <badge> component
      colors: badge({ colors }),
      sizes: badgeSize
    },

```

#### Structure

* tokens/palette.ts - Global tokens
* themes/*theme*/colors.ts - Aliases
* themes/*theme*/*component* - Component tokens
* themes/light - Base theme. All other themes extend the base
