# Definition of done

When working with components (creating/editing), it is recommended to add a checklist to the description of the Pull Request with criteria for the completeness and correctness of the changes being made.
The so-called Definition Of Done.

Check off each item and make sure that nothing is forgotten during development.
The list is not strict and is needed solely for self-control.

### Development of documentation

The docs of each component should be wrapped with the WithMeta hoc, which in turn enriches the documentation with meta information ( review checklist, status and etc. )

#### Example

```
...
import { Alert } from './Alert'
import { AlertProps } from './types'
import { AlertDocs } from './docs'
import { withMeta } from '../../helpers/hooks/MetaComponent/withMeta'
import Meta from './meta.json'

export default {
  title: 'Molecules/Alert',
  component: Alert,
  parameters: {
    badges: [badges.stable, badges.needsDesignReview],
    docs: {
      page: withMeta(Meta)
    }
  }
}
...
```
