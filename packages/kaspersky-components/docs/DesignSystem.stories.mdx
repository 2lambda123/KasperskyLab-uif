# Design System

Description of approaches in using the design system. Resources are located along the path `design-system/`

## Tokens

1. Export the color palette from figma is placed in the file `tokens/figma-colors-tokens.json`.
2. Based on it, gulp task - updateColors builds a file with color tokens `tokens/palette.ts`.
3. For each theme, based on tokens, you need to create a file with aliases (aliases). For example, `themes/light/colors.ts`.
4. If the component uses a color palette for it, you need to create a separate file in the `themes/` folder for each theme. For example, `themes/light/button.ts`
5. Objects with colors and sizes (if necessary) are created to style the component. If the component has several states, for example, active, focus, pressed - the object looks like:
```
const component = {
  active: {
    ...
  },
  focus: {
    ...
  },
  pressed: {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Structure

- `tokens/palette.ts` - Global tokens
- `themes/*theme*/colors.ts` - Aliases
- `themes/*theme*/*component*` - Component tokens
- `themes/light` - Base theme. All other themes extend the base

### Usage

**Only Component Tokens** are used to style the component.

1. If the component uses design tokens, you must create a component token file for each theme.
2. Use Component Tokens in `Themed Hook` to build `Css config`.
3. `Component View` pipe `Css config` into `styled-components` components.
4. Use `Css config` to build `Component css`.
