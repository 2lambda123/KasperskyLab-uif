# Development of components

The UIF platform allows the product team to develop a custom component and use it in their scenarios.
However, if the developed component can be found in scenarios of other products, it makes sense to transfer it to a single registry (package @kaspersky/components) so that all involved teams can reuse common developments.
The transferred components are subject to the same set of technical requirements as those already available in the unified registry.

## General requirements for components:

1. Lack of business logic
2. Scalability and reusability
3. Minimum area of responsibility (atomic principle)
4. Accessibility (visual documentation and description of all complex moments in the component logic)
5. Reliable and transparent code

## General Tips

1. Component View be transparent with respect to native elements (that is, any HTMLAttributes that apply to the container can be passed to the component).
Required for better usability by end users, as well as the ability to add test attributes.
2. Instead of writing "generalized" components for all occasions, we write simple and specific implementations.
Often, an attempt to take into account all possible cases leads to the complication of the code and the inability to maintain it in the future.

## Development and handover process

1. The concept and relevance of the new component are described.

   The transferred component must be approved by the shared library development team.
   This command is responsible for the completeness and relevance of the set of components.

2. A design is requested for a new component.

3. The team makes an MR with a new component (**considering [DoD](/docs/docs-definition-of-done--page)**), and also creates documentation ([according to the rules](/story/docs-template -component-documentation--page)).

4. Once a component has been moved to the shared library, it is the responsibility of the shared library development team to maintain it.
