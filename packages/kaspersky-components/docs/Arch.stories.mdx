# Component Architecture

All components consist of several structural parts

`Component` + `Component View` + `Css config` + `Themed Hook` + `Hooks` = `Component`

Component - the entry point to the component. At a minimum, it uses `Themed Hook` and `Component View`.

Component View - is the basis of the component, contains the minimum amount of logic required. For styling, wraps the used component in `styled-components` which uses `Component css`.
Must be a fully functioning component.

Component css - css styles of the component. Uses `Css config`.

Css config is the component's styling configuration, which includes the required colors, sizes, and typography for the elements.
Returns data as an object, making it easy to override one or more variables as needed.
(Each theme has a separate configuration)

Themed Hook - component theming, creating component style configuration object - `Css config`.

Hooks - the internal logic of the component. Contains logic that is not “essential” for the component.
Allows end users to override the logic of the component.

## Example

```src/button```
