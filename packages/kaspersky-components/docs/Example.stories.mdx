1. List of Defenition of Done

2. Component name, description, usage, design link

3. Table describing the interface of the component
  
4. Main uses of the component

You also need to add `badge`s:

1. Indicating whether the component was taken from **Ant** as the basis or a native element was used.

2. Is there a full-fledged design for the component, if so, attach a design link to `stories`.

3. Whether the component has full support for theming.
(all colors used are taken from the mirror palette)
